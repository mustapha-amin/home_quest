1. Verify Agent Credentials:
Always confirm the agent's identity and credentials. Ask for their license number or any official identification and cross-check with the relevant regulatory body if possible.

2. Bring Someone Along:
If youâ€™re visiting a property, consider bringing a friend or family member with you for added safety.

3. Demand Legal Documentation:
Request and review all necessary legal documents (e.g., tenancy agreement, sale deed, ownership certificate) before making payments.

4. Avoid Paying Cash:
Always make payments through traceable means like bank transfers or checks. Avoid paying cash for deposits or rent.

5. Clarify Terms:
Ensure all terms of the rental or sale are clearly stated in a written agreement to avoid disputes later.

6. Report Suspicious Activity:
Use the app to report any suspicious listings or fraudulent behavior from agents for investigation.

These tips emphasize verification, safety, legal protection, and proactive action against fraud.
